FlopFerret
==========
Texas Hold'em board texture analyzer.

Installation
------------

### Windows
Download the most recent release [here](https://github.com/JulianAndrews/flopferret/releases).

### Linux/OS X
Installation is currently largely manual. You'll need Python2.X. You'll need to download and install [pyEval7](https://github.com/JulianAndrews/pyeval7) via `python setup.py install` (or `python setup.py install --user` for single user installation). This requires Cython. You will also need the `pyparsing` module, and for FlopFerret itself the `pyside` module.

All of these modules are available via `easy_install` or `pip`, and also as packages in the Ubuntu repos.

OS X installation is untested, but theoretically should work. Let me know if you have any questions/comments.
